        "If you have had any type of lip surgery, please consult with the physician about how long you should wait before having cosmetic tattooing on the lips. Most physicians are giving a 3 week “go ahead” after lip filler injections like collagen or Restylane. Although, permanent makeup artists have noticed poor color retention in lips that have received collagen injections within the previous 6 months, and longer for Restylane. There has even been a little pigment migration along lip edges with Restylane. It may be best not to have lip filler injections and permanent lip color within the same year. If the lip surgery involves an incision (like a lip implant), the incision needs to mature about 6 months before tattooing on top of it.",

Frequent or recent sinus infection puts lips at risk of infection. Denture wearers generally carry a higher candida/yeast count."
